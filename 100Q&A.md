## **Java Basics**

----------

# 1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?

JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It contains the tools and
libraries for development of Java programs. It also contains
compilers and debuggers needed to compile Java program,
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. This is included in JDK.
JRE provides libraries and JVM that is required to run a Java
program.

# 2. What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract machine that executes
Java Bytecode. There are different JVM for different hardware and
software platforms. So JVM is platform dependent. JVM is
responsible for loading, verifying and executing the Bytecode on a
platform.

# 3. What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?

In java, JVM allocates memory to different processes, methods and objects. Some of the memory areas allocated by JVM are:


1. ClassLoader: It is a component of JVM used to load class files.

2. Class (Method) Area: It stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods.

3. Heap: Heap is created a runtime and it contains the runtime data area in which objects are cated.
Stack: Stack stores local variables and partial results at runtime. It also helps in method invocation and return value. Each thread creates a private JVM stack at the time of thread reation.

4. Program Counter Register: This memory area contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction that is currently being executed.

5. Native Method Stack: This area is reserved for all the native methods used in the application.

# 4. What is JIT compiler?

Just In Time compiler also known as JIT compiler is used for
performance improvement in Java. It is enabled by default. It is
compilation done at execution time rather earlier.
Java has popularized the use of JIT compiler by including it in
JVM.

# 5. How Java platform is different from other platforms?

Java is a platform independent language. Java compiler converts
Java code in to byte code that can be interpreted by JVM. There are
JVM written for almost all the popular platforms in the world.
Java byte code can run on any supported platform in same way.
Where as other languages require libraries compiled for a specific
platform to run.

# 6. Why people say that Java is 'write once and run anywhere' language?

You can write Java code on Windows and compile it in Windows
platform. The class and jar files that you get from Windows
platform can run as it is on Unix environment. So it is a truly
platform independent language.
Behind all this portability is Java byte code. Byte code generated by
Java compiler can be interpreted by any JVM. So it becomes much
easier to write programs in Java and expect those to run on any
platform.
Java compiler javac compiles java code and JVM java runs that
code.

# 7. How does ClassLoader work in Java?

In Java, ClassLoader is a class that is used to load files in JVM.
ClassLoader loads files from their physical file locations e.g.
Filesystem, Network location etc.
There are three main types of ClassLoaders in Java.

1. Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first ClassLoader. It loads classes from rt.jar file.

2. Extension ClassLoader: It loads class files from jre/lib/ext location.

3. Application ClassLoader: This ClassLoader depends on CLASSPATH to find the location of class files. If you
specify your jars in CLASSPATH, then this ClassLoader will load them.


# 8. Do you think ‘main’ used for main method is a keyword in Java?

No, main is just a name of method. There can be multiple methods
with same name main in a class file. It is not a keyword in Java.

# 9. Can we write main method as public void static instead of public static void?

No, you cannot write it like this. Any method has to first specify the
modifiers and then the return value. The order of modifiers can
change.

We can write static public void main() instead of public static void
main().

# 10. In Java, if we do not specify any value for local variables, then what will be the default value of the local variables?

Java does not initialize local variables with any default value. So
these variables will be just null by default.

# 11. Let say, we run a java class withoutpassing any arguments. What will be the value of String array of arguments in Main method?

By default, the value of String array of arguments is empty in Java.
It is not null.

# 12. What is the difference between byte and char data types in Java?

Both byte and char are numeric data types in Java. They are used to
represent numbers in a specific range.

Major difference between them is that a byte can store raw binary
data where as a char stores characters or text data.

Usage of char is E.g. char ch = ‘x’;
Byte values range from -128 to 127.

A byte is made of 8 bits. But a char is made of 16 bits. So it is
equivalent to 2 bytes.


----------

## **OOPS**

----------

# 13. What are the main principles of Object Oriented Programming?

Main principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) are:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

# 14. What is the difference between Object Oriented Programming language and Object Based Programming language?

Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and C++ follow
concepts of OOPS like- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism
and Inheritance etc.

Object Based Programming languages follow some features of
OOPS but they do not provide support for Polymorphism and
Inheritance. Egg. JavaScript, VBScript etc.

Object Based Programming languages provide support for Objects
and you can build objects from constructor. They languages also
support Encapsulation. These are also known as Prototype-oriented
languages.

# 15. In Java what is the default value of an object reference defined as an instance variable in an Object?

All the instance variable object references in Java are null.

# 16. Why do we need constructor in Java?

Java is an object-oriented language, in which we create and use
objects. A constructor is a piece of code similar to a method. It is
used to create an object and set the initial state of the object.

A constructor is a special function that has same name as class name.

Without a constructor, there is no other way to create an object.

By default, Java provides a default constructor for every object. If
we overload a constructor then we have to implement default
constructor.

# 17. Why do we need default constructor in Java classes?

Default constructor is the no-argument constructor that is
automatically generated by Java if no other constructor is defined.

Java specification says that it will provide a default constructor if
there is no overloaded constructor in a class. But it does not say
anything about the scenario in which we write an overloaded
constructor in a class.

We need at least one constructor to create an object, that’s why Java
provides a default constructor.

When we have overloaded constructor, then Java assumes that we
want some custom treatment in our code. Due to which it does not
provide default constructor. But it needs default constructor as per
the specification. So it gives error.

# 18. What is the value returned by Constructor in Java?

When we call a constructor in Java, it returns the object created by
it. That is how we create new objects in Java.

# 19. Can we inherit a Constructor?

No, Java does not support inheritance of constructor.

# 20. Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?

If we set a method as final it means we do not want any class to
override it. But the constructor (as per Java Language
Specification) cannot be overridden. So there is no use of marking it
final.
If we set a method as abstract it means that it has no body and it
should be implemented in a child class. But the constructor is called
implicitly when the new keyword is used. Therefore it needs a
body.
If we set a method as static it means that it belongs to the class, but
not a particular object. The constructor is always called to initialize
an object. Therefore, there is no use of marking constructor static.


----------

## **Inheritance**

----------


# 21. What is the purpose of ‘this’ keyword in java?

In Java, ‘this’ keyword refers to current instance of the object.
It is useful for differentiating between instance variables and local
variables.

It can be used to call constructors. Or it can be used to refer to the
instance.

In case of method overriding, this is used for falling the method of
current class.

# 22. Explain the concept of Inheritance?

Inheritance is an important concept in Object Oriented
Programming. Some objects share certain characteristics and
behavior. By using Inheritance, we can put the common behavior
and characteristics in a base class which also known as super class.
And then all the objects with common behavior inherit from this
base class.

It is also represented by IS-A relationship.

Inheritance promotes, code reuse, method overriding and poly-morphism.

# 23. Which class in Java is superclass of every other class?

Java is an object oriented programming language. In Java, Object
class is the superclass of every other class.

# 24. Why Java does not support multiple inheritance?

Multiple Inheritance means that a class can inherit behavior from
two or more parent classes.

The issue with Multiple Inheritance is that both the parent classes
may have different implementation for the same method. So they
have different ways of doing the same thing. Now which
implementation should the child class choose?

This leads to ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance. This is the main
reason for Java not supporting Multiple Inheritance in
implementation.

Lets say you have a class TV and another class AtomBomb. Both
have method switchOn() but only TV has switchOff() method. If
your class inherits from both these classes then you have an issue
that you can switchOn() both parents, but switchOff will only
switchOff() TV.

But you can implement multiple interfaces in Java.

# 25. In OOPS, what is meant by composition?

Composition is also known as “has-a” relationship. In composition,
“has-a” relation relates two classes. E.g. Class Car has a steering
wheel.
If a class holds the instance of another class, then it is called
composition.

# 26. How aggregation and composition are different concepts?

In OOPS, Aggregation and Composition are the types of association
relations. A composition is a strong relationship. If the composite
object is destroyed, then all its parts are destroyed. E.g. A Car has a
Steering Wheel. If Car object is destroyed, then there is no meaning
of Steering Wheel.

In Aggregation, the relationship is weaker than Composition.

E.g. A Library has students. If a Library is destroyed, Students still
exist. So Library and Student are related by Aggregation. A Library
has Books. If Library is destroyed, the Books are also destroyed.
Books of a Library cannot exist without the Library. So Book and
Library are related by Composition.

# 27. Why there are no pointers in Java?

In Java there are references instead of pointers. These references
point to objects in memory. But there is no direct access to these
memory locations. JVM is free to move the objects within VM
memory.

The absence of pointers helps Java in managing memory and
garbage collection effectively. Also it provides developers with
convenience of not getting worried about memory allocation and de-
allocation.

# 28. If there are no pointers in Java, then why do we get NullPointerException?

In Java, the pointer equivalent is Object reference. When we use a .it points to object reference. So JVM uses pointers but programmers only see object references.

In case an object reference points to null object, and we try to
access a method or member variable on it, then we get
NullPointerException.

# 29. What is the purpose of ‘super’ keyword in java?

‘super’ keyword is used in the methods or constructor of a child
class. It refers to immediate parent class of an object.

By using ‘super’ we can call a method of parent class from the
method of a child class.

We can also call the constructor of a parent class from the
constructor of a child class by using ‘super’ keyword.

# 30. Is it possible to use this() and super() both in same constructor?

No, Java does not allow using both super() and this() in same
constructor. As per Java specification, super() or this() must be the
first statement in a constructor.

# 31. What is the meaning of object cloning in Java?

Object.clone() method is used for creating an exact copy of the
object in Java. It acts like a copy constructor. It creates and returns
a copy of the object, with the same class and with all the fields
having same values as of the original object.

One disadvantage of cloning is that the return type is an Object. It
has to be explicitly cast to actual type.



----------

## **Static**

----------


# 32. In Java, why do we use static variable?

Whenever we want to have a common property for all objects of a
class, we use a class level variable i.e. a static variable.

This variable is loaded in memory only once at the time of class
loading. So it saves memory, since it is not defined per object in
Java.

# 33. Why it is not a good practice to create static variables in Java?

Static variables are common to all the objects of a class. If a new
object is created, there is no need to test the value of static variable.
Any code that uses static variable can be in any state. It can be
within a new object or at a class level. So the scope of static
variable is open ended in a Java class.

If we want tighter control on scope, then variables should be
created at the object creation level.

Also defining static variables is not a good practice because they go
against the principles of Object Oriented Programming.

# 34. What is the purpose of static method in Java?

Java provides the feature of static method to create behavior at the
class level. The static method is common to all the objects of a
class. We do not need to create any object of a class to call a static
method. So it provides convenience of not creating an object for
calling it.

Also a static method can access and modify static data members.
This also helps in keeping the behavior as well as state at the class
level.

# 35. Why do we mark main method as static in Java?

The main method in Java is marked as static, so that JVM can call it
to start the program. If main method is not static, then which
constructor will be called by Java process?

As such it is a known as convention to mark main method static in
Java. But if we remove the static, then there will be ambiguity. Java
process may not know which method of a class to call to start the
program.

So this convention helps in Java process to identify the starting code
for a program in class that is passed as an argument to java process.

# 36. In what scenario do we use a static block?

At times, there is a class that has static member variables. These
variables need some complicated initialization. At this time static
block helps as a tool to initialize complex static member variable
initialization.

The static block is executed even before the execution of main.

Sometimes, we can also replace static block with a static method of
class.

# 37. Is it possible to execute a program without defining a main() method?

No, with Java 7 onwards, you need a main() method to execute a
program. In earlier versions of Java, there was a workaround
available to use static blocks for execution. But now this gap has
been closed.

# 38. What happens when static modifier is not mentioned in the signature of main method?

As per Java specification, main method has to be marked as static.
It needs only one argument that is an array of String.

A program can compile with a non-static method. But on execution
it will give NoSuchMethodError.

# 39. What is the difference between static method and instance method in Java? 

Often, there is a need to define a behavior for a class that is not
dependent on member variables of an object. Such behavior is
captured in a static method. If there is a behavior dependent upon
the member variables of an object, then we do not mark it static, it
remains as instance method.

To call as static method, we do not need to create an object. We just
call it with class name. But to call an instance method, we need to
create/get an object first.

Instance member variables cannot be accessed by a static method.
But an instance method can call both instance variables and static
variables.



----------

## **Method Overloading and Overriding**

----------



# 40. What is the other name of Method Overloading?

Method Overloading is also known as Static Polymorphism.

# 41. How will you implement method overloading in Java?

In Java, a class can have multiple methods with same name but
different arguments. It is called Method Overloading. To implement
method overloading we have to create two methods with same name
in a class and do one/more of the following:

1. Different number of parameters
2. Different data type of parameters
3. Different sequence of data type of parameters

# 42. What kinds of argument variations are allowed in Method Overloading?

Method Overloading allows two methods with same name to differ in:

1. Number of parameters
2. Data type of parameters
3. Sequence of data type of parameters

# 43. Why it is not possible to do method overloading by changing return type of method in java?

If we change the return type of overloaded methods then it will lead
to ambiguous behavior. How will clients know which method will
return what type. Due to this different return type are not allowed in
overloaded methods.

# 44. Is it allowed to overload main() method in Java?

Yes, Java allows users to create many methods with same name
‘main’. But only public static void main(String[] args) method is
used for execution.

# 45. How do we implement method overriding in Java?

To override a method, we just provide a new implementation of a
method with same name in subclass. So there will be at least two
implementations of the method with same name. One
implementation is in parent class. And another implementation is in
child class.

# 46. Are we allowed to override a static method in Java?

No. Java does not allow overriding a static method. If you create a
static method with same name in subclass, then it is a new method,
not an overridden method.

# 47. Why Java does not allow overriding a static method?

To override a method, you need an instance of a class. Static method
is not associated with any instance of the class. So the concept of
overriding does not apply here.

Therefore, Java does not allow overriding a static method.

# 48. Is it allowed to override an overloaded method?

Yes. You can override an overloaded method in Java.

# 49. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java?

Differences between method overloading and overriding are:

1. Method overloading is static polymorphism. Method overriding is runtime polymorphism.

2. Method overloading occurs within the same class. Method overriding happens in two classes with hierarchy relationship.

3. Parameters must be different in method overloading.Parameters must be same in method overriding.

4. Method overloading is a compile time concept. Method overriding is a runtime concept.

# 50. Does Java allow virtual functions?

Yes. All instance methods in Java are virtual functions by default.
Only class methods and private instance methods are not virtual
methods in Java.

# 51. What is meant by covariant return type in Java?

A covariant return type of a method is one that can be replaced by a
"narrower" type when the method is overridden in a subclass.

Let say class B is child of class A. There is a get() method in class
A as well as class B. get() method of class A can return an instance
of A, and get() method of class B return an instance of B. Here
class B overrides get() method, but the return type is different.

Before Java 5, any method that overrides the method of parent class
would have same return type.

From Java 5 onwards, a child class can override a method of parent
class and the child class method can return an object that is child of
object return by parent class method.


----------

## **Polymorphism**

----------


# 52. What is Runtime Polymorphism?

Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Polymorphism is the
polymorphism that exists at runtime. In case of method overriding it
is not known which method will be called at runtime. Based on the
type of object, JVM decides the exact method that should be called.

So at compile time it is not known which method will be called at
run time.

# 53. Is it possible to achieve Runtime Polymorphism by data members in Java?

No. We need to create Runtime Polymorphism by implementing
methods at two levels of inheritance in Java.

# 54. Explain the difference between static and dynamic binding?

In Static binding references are resolved at compile time. In
Dynamic binding references are resolved at Run time.

```
E.g.
Person p = new Person();
p.walk(); // Java compiler resolves this binding at compile time.
public void walk(Object o){
((Person) o).walk(); // this is dynamic binding.
}
```


----------

## **Abstraction**

----------


# 55. What is Abstraction in Object Oriented programming?

Abstraction is the process of hiding certain implementation details
of an object and showing only essential features of the object to
outside world.

It is different from Abstract class in Java.

Abstraction process identifies commonalities and hides the
complexity of implementation. It helps us in focusing on the
interface that we share with the outside world.

# 56. How is Abstraction different from Encapsulation?

Abstraction happens at class level design. It results in hiding the
implementation details. Encapsulation is also known as
“Information Hiding”. An example of encapsulation is marking the
member variables private and providing getter and setter for these
member variables.

# 57. What is an abstract class in Java?

An abstract class in Java has one or more abstract methods. An
abstract method is just declared in the abstract class, but it is not
implemented.

An abstract class has to be extended in Java and its abstract
methods have to be implemented by a child class. Also Java does
not allow new instance of Abstract class.

# 58. Is it allowed to mark a method abstract method without marking the class abstract?

No. Java specification says that if there is at least one abstract
method in a class, the class has to be marked abstract.

# 59. Is it allowed to mark a method abstract as well as final?

No. It will be contradictory statement to mark a method abstract as
well as final.

An abstract method has to be overridden by a child class. And a
final method cannot be overridden. Therefore a method can be
either abstract or final in Java.

# 60. Can we instantiate an abstract class in Java?

No. We cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Java.

# 61. What is an interface in Java?

An Interface in Java is an abstract type blueprint of a class. It
contains the methods that a class must implement. It is like a
protocol.

It has method signatures and constant declarations.

# 62. Is it allowed to mark an interface method as static?

Yes, from Java 8 onwards, we can define static and default methods
in an interface. Prior to Java 8, it was not allowed.

# 63. Why an Interface cannot be marked as final in Java?

A final method cannot be overridden. But an interface method has to
be implemented by another class. So the interface method cannot be
marked as final.

# 64. What is a marker interface?

There are interfaces that do not have any data member or methods.
These interfaces are called Marker interface.
E.g. Serializable, Cloneable, Remote etc.

# 65. What can we use instead of Marker interface?

We can use annotations instead of Marker interface.

# 66. How Annotations are better than Marker Interfaces?

Annotations serve the purpose of conveying metadata about the
class to its consumers without creating a separate type for it.

Annotations are more powerful than a Marker interface. They allow
programmers to pass more sophisticated information to classes that
"consume" it.

# 67. What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?

Differences between Abstract class and Interface are as follows:

1. An abstract class can have implemented methods with
body (non-abstract methods). Interface has only abstract
methods. From Java 8 onwards, interface can have
static/default methods in implemented form.

2. An abstract class can have instance member variables. An
interface cannot have instance variables. It can only have
constants.

3. An abstract class can have a constructor. Interface cannot
have constructor. It has to be implemented by another
class.

4. A class can extend only one abstract class. A class can
implement more than one interface.


# 68. Does Java allow us to use private and protected modifiers for variables in interfaces?

No. All the variables in an interface are implicitly public.

# 69. How can we cast to an object reference to an interface reference?

An Object that implements an Interface can be cast to the same
Interface. Since An Object implementing an Interface already
provides implementation for the methods of that Interface, it is
allowed to do so as per the rules of Inheritance.


----------

## **FINAL**

----------


# 70. How can you change the value of a final variable in Java?

Java does not allow changing the value of a final variable. Once the
value is set, it cannot be changed.

# 71. Can a class be marked final in Java?

Yes a class can be marked final in Java. Once a class is marked
final, it cannot be extended.

# 72. How can we create a final method in Java?

To mark a method, add modifier final to that method. A final method
can not be overridden by a child class.

# 73. How can we prohibit inheritance in Java?

If you mark a class final, it cannot be extended. This will prohibit
the inheritance of that class in Java.

# 74. Why Integer class in final in Java?

Integer class is a wrapper for int. If it is not marked final, then any
other class can extend it and modify the behavior of Integer
operations. To avoid this Integer wrapper class is marked as final.

# 75. What is a blank final variable in Java?

When we declare a final variable without giving any initial value,
then it is called blank final variable.

# 76. How can we initialize a blank final variable?

A blank final instance variable can be initialized in a constructor.

A blank final static variable can be initialized in the static block of
class.

# 77. Is it allowed to declare main method as final?

Yes, we can mark the main method as final.


----------

## **Package**

----------


# 78. What is the purpose of package in Java?

A package is used to encapsulate a group of classes, interfaces and
sub-packages. Often, it is a hierarchical structure of storing
information. It is easier to organize the related classes and sub-
packages in this manner.

A Package also provides access protection for classes and
interfaces. A package also helps in removing naming collision.

# 79. What is java.lang package?

In Java, java.lang package contains the classes that are fundamental
to the design of Java programming language. The most important
class in this package is Object class.

It also contains wrapper classes like- Integer, Boolean, Character
etc. It provides Math class for mathematical operations.

# 80. Which is the most important class in Java?

It is an open-ended question with many answers. In my view, Object
class is the most important class of Java programming language. It
is the root of all the classes in Java. It provides some very
important and fundamental methods.

# 81. Is it mandatory to import java.lang package every time?

No. By default, JVM loads it internally.

# 82. Can you import same package or class twice in your class?

If we import same package multiple times in a class, compiler
includes it only once. So neither JVM nor Compiler gives any
error/warning on including a package multiple times.

If you have two classes with same name, then you may get name
collision on importing the class erroneously.

JVM internally loads the class only one time.

# 83. What is a static import in Java?

Static import is similar to normal import declaration. Normal
import allows us to import classes from packages without using
package qualifier. Static import allows us to import static members
from a class without using class qualifier.

# 84. What is the difference between import static com.test.Fooclass and import com.test.Fooclass?

First import is a static import and the second import is normal
import of a class. First import allows us to import static members of
class.


----------

## **Internationalization**

----------


# 85. What is Locale in Java?

A Locale object represents a specific geographical, political, or
cultural region. It is used to locale-sensitive operations in Java.

It helps is following the local conventions of a country, native or
region. These conventions can be for formatting the dates, money,
numbers etc.

# 86. How will you use a specific Locale in Java?

To use a specific Locale, we need to load that Locale. We can use
ResourceBundle.getBundle("Locale.UK") method to load a Locale.



----------

## **Serialization**

----------



# 87. What is the serialization?

Serialization is a process converting an object into a byte array.
This byte array represents the class, version and internal state of the
object. JVM can use this byte array to transmit/read the object over
a network.

# 88. What is the purpose of serialization?

Some of the uses of serialization are:

1. Communication: It is used for transmitting an object over network between two machines.

2. Persistence: We can store the object’s state in a database and retrieve it from database later on.

3. Caching: Serialization can be used for caching to improve performance. We may need 10 minutes to build an object, but it may take just 10 seconds to de-serialize the object.

4. Cross JVM Synchronization: It can be used in same way across multiple JVM that follow different architecture.

# 89. What is Deserialization?

Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the
serialized state. It is the reverse process of serialization.

# 90. What is Serialization and Deserialization conceptually?

Serialization is to convert Object data into a stream of bytes

Deserialization is to convert a stream of bytes back into a copy of
the original object.

# 91. Why do we mark a data member transient?

Member variables of an object are marked transient to indicate that
they should not be serialized.

During serialization process the transient variables are not
considered part of the persistent state of an object.

# 92. Is it allowed to mark a method as transient?

No, Java does not allow marking a method as transient. The
transient keyword is valid only for member variables.

# 93. How does marking a field as transient makes it possible to serialize an object?

Let say we have a class ABC that implements Serializable
interface, but it contains a member variable object of class XYZ
that does not implement Serializable interface. Due to this it is not
possible to Serialize the class ABC.

To solve this issue, we can mark the member variable XYZ as
Transient in class ABC. This will allow us to serialize the class
ABC.

# 94. What is Externalizable interface in Java?

Externalizable interface extends Serializable interface in Java. It is
used for giving the Class control over saving and restoring the
contents of its instances.

A class implements methods writeExternal() and readExternal() to
store and restore the object.

# 95. What is the difference between Serializable and Externalizable interface?

Serializable is a marker interface but Externalizable is not a marker
interface.

When we implement Serializable interface, the class is serialized
automatically by default. We can override writeObject() and
readObject()methods to control more complex object Serialization
process.

In case of Externalizable, we use readExternal() and
writeExternal() methods to give control to class for class's
serialization process.

Serializable interface is based on recursive algorithm.

Serializable gives you two options. One option is to provide custom
way of serialization, the other default way. In Externalizable, you
have to always implement readExternal() and writeExternal()
methods.

A public no-arg constructor is needed while using Externalizable
interface.

In Serialization, we need to define serialVersionUID. If it is not
explicitly defined it will be generated automatically based on all the
fields, methods of the class.

# 96. What is Reflection in Java?

Reflection is Java language's ability to inspect and dynamically call
classes, methods, attributes etc. at Runtime. It helps in examining or
modifying the Runtime behavior of a class at Runtime.

# 97. What are the uses of Reflection in Java?

Reflection is often used in Testing, Debugging and in Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).

Reflection allows you to write programs that do not have to "know"
everything at compile time. It makes programs more dynamic, since
they can be tied together at runtime.

Many modern frameworks like Spring etc. use Reflection. Some
modern languages like Python etc. also use Reflection.

JAVA API for XML Parsing (JAXP) also uses Reflection.

# 98. How can we access private method of a class from outside the class?

We can use Reflection to access private method of a class from
outside the class. IN Java, we use getDeclaredMethod() to get
instance of a private method. Then we mark this method accessible
and finally invoke it.

In following sample code, we are accessing private method
message() of class Foo by Reflection.

```
FileName: Foo.java
public class Foo {
private void message(){System.out.println("hello java"); }
}
```

```
FileName: FooMethodCall.java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public class FooMethodCall{
public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception{
Class c = Class.forName("Foo");
Object o= c.newInstance();
Method m =c.getDeclaredMethod("message", null);
m.setAccessible(true);
m.invoke(o, null);
}
}
```

# 99. How can we create an Object dynamically at Runtime in Java?

We can use Reflection to create an Object dynamically at Runtime
in Java. We can use Class.newInstance() or
Constructor.newInstance() methods for creating such Objects.

# 100. What is Garbage Collection in Java?

Java has an internal mechanism called Garbage collection to
reclaim the memory of unused projects at run time.

Garbage collection is also known as automatic memory
management.
